# Brightness-Control
A real-time hand gesture recognition project that adjusts screen brightness based on the distance between your thumb and index finger. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this project uses computer vision and Euclidean distance mapping to offer touch-free brightness control.
